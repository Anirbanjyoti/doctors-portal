              I'm Dr. Holleh Tajalli! I'm a dentist who has long wanted to
              create a fun environment to deliver the best dental care to YOU! I
              studied at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry in
              downtown Baltimore. I loved Baltimore so much, I never left! I've
              worked in many offices around Maryland and am very excited to
              finally be able to service our city of Baltimore! Over the last
              few years, I have been often asked by members of our community
              where my practice is located so that they can come see me, but I
              simply worked too far away. That's when I knew I had to make a
              change, to build a beautiful office and environment with the
              latest technology that puts the patient experience first. Come see
              the difference! If you are looking to brighten and enhance your
              smile, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us today at (410)
              921-0097!
